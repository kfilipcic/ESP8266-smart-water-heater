</kbd></br>This dialog opens when clicking on a specific device. The image is pretty much self explanatory. The "Automatically keep temperatures in range" checkbox does just that - when it detects that the current device temperature isn't within the given range, it automatically changes the state of the device accordingly.</br>

</kbd></br>Every device type has it's own small icon. If set in the settings dialog, a notification is shown when the temperature of a device is not within the set values. If the "Automatically keep temperatures in range" options is set, the notification informs the user that the state is being changed (as seen on the image).</br>
